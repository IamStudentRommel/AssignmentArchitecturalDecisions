# Backend Language
Choosing the appropriate backend language is vital as it directly impacts the retail application's performance, responsiveness, and its ability to adapt to the dynamic requirements of a retail environment.

### Decision:
The backend development will utilize Node.js.

### Justification:
Node.js, with its lightweight nature and extensive ecosystem of packages, aligns well with the project's requirements, making it a suitable choice for a backend that needs to handle concurrent requests efficiently. Its proficiency in handling asynchronous operations further enhances its appropriateness for the task.
