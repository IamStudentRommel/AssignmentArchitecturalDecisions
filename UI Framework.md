### Decision:
The User Interface will be built using the React Native framework.

### Justification:
React Native is the most appropriate one for the UI framework in the retail app due to the following reasons.

•	Enabling the development of cross-platform applications with a single codebase, React Native promotes efficient resource utilization and expedites development timelines. This aligns with the retail company's objective of delivering a consistent user experience across diverse platforms.
•	With a rich collection of pre-built components and a declarative syntax, React Native facilitates the creation of visually appealing and responsive user interfaces, enhancing the overall design quality.
•	Ensures smooth integration with native modules.

In addition to this, to ensure a smooth and visually pleasing design experience for users, the team will utilize Native Wind. Constructed on top of Tailwind CSS for React Native, this framework can effectively develop contemporary and responsive mobile applications by integrating the capabilities of Native Wind with React Native. The utility-first approach of Native Wind allows straightforward customization of UI components, ensuring a robust foundation for constructing visually appealing and high-performing cross-platform mobile applications.
