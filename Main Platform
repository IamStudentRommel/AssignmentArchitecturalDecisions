### Native, Web, or Hybrid App
The decision revolves around determining whether the application should adopt a native, web, or hybrid approach, considering factors such as performance, user experience, and development efficiency. Selecting the most suitable option is crucial, and the choice of the UI framework will significantly impact the design and implementation of the user interface.

### Offline Mode Support

- **Pros:** Achieves optimal performance, ensures fluid user experience, and leverages platform-specific features for enhanced functionality.
- **Cons:** Requires separate development efforts for iOS and Android, potentially resulting in extended project timelines.

### Web App

- **Pros:** Provides compatibility across various platforms, allows for efficient updates, and can be accessed through standard web browsers.
- **Cons:** Faces limitations in accessing device-specific features and may experience performance trade-offs.

### Hybrid App

 - **Pros:** Balance between cross-platform compatibility and native-like experience, single codebase.
- **Pros:** May not consistently match the performance of native apps in certain scenarios.

### Decision:
The development will focus on creating a mobile app with native features.

### Justification:
A native mobile app is preferred in this scenario due to its superior speed and responsiveness, despite the potential need for separate codebases. In retail applications, where performance is crucial for seamless user interactions and real-time updates, the optimized and platform-specific nature of native development ensures an enhanced user experience, making it the preferred choice over alternatives like web or hybrid apps.
