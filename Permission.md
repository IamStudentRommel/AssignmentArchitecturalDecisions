# Permissions
As the application endeavors to offer advanced features such as offline mode, push notifications, secure payment gateways, user behavior tracking, image optimization, and internationalization. To implement these functions, the team needs to establish a strong permissions model that regulates access and interactions within the application.

### Decision:
The application will utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to handle authentication and implement role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.

### Justification:
Utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization is the best choice. JWT ensures secure user authentication with digitally signed tokens, promoting scalability and reducing server-side storage needs. Combined with RBAC, which assigns roles to users, this model provides a flexible and detailed permissions structure.
